# VegaDNS CLI

VegaDNS CLI is a command line interface for [VegaDNS-API](https://github.com/shupp/VegaDNS-API) written in python.  It is comprised of a thin REST wrapper with [OAuth2 section 4.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4) support, vegadns_client, and a [Click](http://click.pocoo.org/5/) based cli wrapper, vegadns_cli.  If you wish, you can write your own integration with the API using the vegadns_client wrapper.  See the [integration tests](https://github.com/shupp/VegaDNS-CLI/blob/master/integration_tests/test_domain.py) for example usage.

## Installation and upgrades

Installation should be done through [pip3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).  For a first time global installation, you can do the following:

```
sudo pip3 install https://github.com/shupp/VegaDNS-CLI/archive/master.zip
```

For subsequent updates, you can use the builtin _upgrade_ command:

```
sudo vdns upgrade
```

## Configuring

To connect to your VegaDNS2 API, you'll need to set the host url, your api key, and api secret.

### From a brand new api install
For a brand new installation, you can start with the seeded account information and change it later when you create accounts:

```
vdns config set --host <your_api_url> \
    --key 6d145840921dabcc85907bff35e607289abdad04b7900196ee45f5a4e12ac369 \
    --secret b1163b6387318dbfebaca5740ddb024ad61fa18831bb887ea085036f8df9c180
```

### From email/password
If someone created an account for you, and you need to create api keys from a given email/password, you can currently use curl and basic auth to generate the keys:

```
curl -X POST -u <email>:<password> <api_host>/1.0/apikeys
```
In the response JSON response you'll see a _key_ and _secret_.  Use those values and follow the _config set_ example above.

## Using the _vdns_ cli tool

The vdns tool should be self explanatory.  To see the list of commands available, you can call it without any arguments:

```
Usage: vdns [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  A command line interface for managing VegaDNS

Options:
  -e, --environment TEXT  Which environment config to use, default is
                          'default'
  -d, --debug             Enables HTTP debug logs
  --help                  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  accounts         Manage accounts
  apikeys          Manage account api keys
  audit_logs       List audit logs
  config           Manage the config for the current environment
  default_records  Manage default records

```
As you can see, if you work with multiple VegaDNS2 installations, you can use _-e <environment>_ as a global argument to all commands specify which api to talk to.  The default is _default_.

Note that you can always use _--help_ with any command to see its usage:

```
$ vdns records --help
Usage: vdns records [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.
